# ATS_RESUME_ANALYZER
AI-Powered ATS Resume Screening System A production-ready Applicant Tracking System that automatically analyzes, scores, and ranks resumes against job descriptions using skill intelligence, semantic similarity, and weighted ATS logic. Built with FastAPI &amp; Streamlit to simulate real-world recruiter workflows.
🚀 AI-Powered Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

Enterprise-grade resume screening & candidate ranking platform powered by AI
Automatically analyzes, scores, ranks, and shortlists up to 1000 resumes at once against a job description with realistic ATS logic.

📌 Overview

This project is a production-ready Applicant Tracking System (ATS) designed to simulate how real-world enterprise ATS platforms (used by MNCs, consulting firms, and HR tech companies) evaluate resumes.

The system intelligently processes large-scale resume inputs, extracts only validated skills, calculates accurate ATS scores, and automatically shortlists top candidates — eliminating manual screening and reducing recruiter bias.

Unlike basic keyword-based ATS tools, this system focuses on accuracy, explainability, and scalability.

🎯 Why This ATS Is Different

Most ATS systems fail due to:

❌ Blind keyword matching

❌ Unrealistic 100% scores

❌ English phrases treated as skills

❌ Manual skill configuration per job role

❌ No transparency in rejection reasons

This system solves all of the above by design.

✨ Core Features
🔍 Intelligent Resume Screening

Upload 1 to 1000 resumes at once

Supports batch processing for enterprise hiring

Automatically ranks candidates based on ATS score

🧠 Job Description Driven Skill Matching

No hardcoded skills per role

Skills are derived directly from the job description

Uses a strict skill whitelist database to prevent noise

Eliminates false positives like:

“work closely with team”

“basic understanding of business”

“want hands-on exposure”

✅ Accurate Skill Extraction

Extracts only real, validated skills

Supports:

Programming languages

QA tools

Testing skills

Data & analytics skills

Development tools

Soft skills (controlled)

🎯 Key Capabilities

✅ Upload single or multiple resumes (up to 1000 at once)

✅ Job-description-driven skill extraction (no hardcoded skills per role)

✅ Accurate matched & missing skills detection

✅ Realistic ATS score (0–100) with float precision

✅ Section-wise scoring:

Skills

Semantic similarity

Experience

Projects

Education

✅ Automatic candidate ranking & shortlisting

✅ Recruiter-friendly Streamlit UI

✅ Production-ready FastAPI backend

📊 Realistic ATS Scoring (0–100)

Each resume receives a float-based ATS score, not a binary pass/fail.

Section-wise weighted evaluation:
Section	Weight
Skills Match	35%
JD Similarity	25%
Experience	20%
Projects	10%
Education	10%

This mirrors real hiring system logic used in enterprise recruitment.

🧮 Section Score Breakdown

For every candidate, the system provides:

Final ATS Score

Matched Skills

Missing Skills

Detailed section scores

Hire / Reject decision

📌 This makes the system fully explainable and auditable.

🏆 Automatic Shortlisting

Configurable shortlisting threshold (e.g. 80+ ATS score)

Only top candidates are shortlisted

All candidates are ranked for transparency

🖥️ Recruiter-Friendly Streamlit UI

Clean, professional interface

Upload resumes & job description

View rankings instantly

No technical knowledge required

⚙️ Scalable Backend Architecture

Built with FastAPI

Modular design

Easy to integrate with:

HR portals

Hiring dashboards

Cloud infrastructure

🧠 How the ATS Thinks (Logic Flow)

Job Description Parsing

Skill normalization using skill database

Resume skill extraction

Skill match ratio calculation

Semantic similarity analysis

Experience & project scoring

Weighted ATS score generation

Ranking & shortlisting
